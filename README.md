# ComputerVision_with_TensorFlow
 
ðŸ§  Computer Vision with TensorFlow (Google Guided Project)

This is a 1-hour self-paced lab hosted in the Google Cloud console, designed to introduce the basics of computer vision using TensorFlow. In this project, I built a neural network capable of recognizing various items of clothing using the Fashion MNIST dataset.
Throughout the lab, I explored how changes in model parameters and training processes can affect accuracy and performance.

ðŸ§ª What I Did:

    Trained a computer vision model using TensorFlow and Keras

    Used the Fashion MNIST dataset for image classification

    Tweaked model architecture to observe effects on training and accuracy

    Ran everything in Google Cloud via Qwiklabs

ðŸ”§ Tech Stack:

    TensorFlow

    Python

    Google Cloud Platform (Qwiklabs)
